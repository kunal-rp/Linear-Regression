This is an example of Linear Regression using Octave

From Coursera's ML course

1) Imports the data from data files

2) Normalizes all values of x
	-Depending on the data set, the value range of a paticular feature could be too big/small
	-Normalizing the values to values between -1 and 1 helps the program better handle these values
3) Initialize theta values to zero

4) Perform gradient descent

5)Print out tetha results and the cost history
