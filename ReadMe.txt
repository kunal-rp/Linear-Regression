New plan for Learning Machine Learning

So it's gone to the point where I am trying to learn ML, but I keep on going in circles with languages and tutorials. 

It's time for a change.

I recently watched a video on Youtube regarding how to pproperly learn ML in half a year

I think I am going to follow this model.

Part 1: the Math

Probably going to use MIT open course to learn the necessary math. While I have been able to keep up with the math so far in the tutorials, I fear this may be the hardest part.
-linear algebra
-caculus
-statistics

1-2 months(maybe more)

Part 2:learn the languages

Python and R are the leading languages atm, and I already know python, so basically I am learning R

1 month

Thats the plan so far, I will try and post more often or start a running diary about this on my website.
