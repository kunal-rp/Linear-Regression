Imagine you are given a scatter plot graph, and you had to find the line that hits all of the points:

For this graph, we can visually see that a simple line can go through all points of the graph.

If we really wanted to, we could represent the line in the y = mx + b formula, the formula being y = -3x +5. Obviously, there is also a mathematic way to dertive the slope, the y-intercept, ect. but I'm assuming you already know all that basic stuff :)

Now how about for THIS graph:

Now, a linear line cannot pass through all of the points. So what can we do?

Again, visually, we can't get a perfect line, but we can maybe draw the BEST FIT LINE :

This process, the idea of finding the best fit linear line of a scatter plot, is the idea behind linear regression, one of the basic models for Machine Learning!
